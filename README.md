# About The Project

The program utilizes Morse code for both encoding and decoding messages. Morse code is a widely used system for encoding messages, comprising letters and numbers. Each letter is represented by a sequence of dots (.) and dashes (-). For instance, the code for the letter 'a' is •– and for the letter 'b' it is –•••.

In this program, users can input the message they want to encode. The program then encodes the message and displays it in Morse code format. Additionally, it can decode the coded message and display the original input message.


# Build With
The c++ program is built using Visual Studio Code on MacOS.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites 
1. An integrated development environment (IDE) capable of running c++ programs, such as CLion, Visual Studio Code and Eclipse installed.
2. Mac OS or Window OS.
3. An internet connection to check out the project from the repository.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
    git clone https://github.com/swezinooszo/cs700-a5.git


## Usage
Please follow the below steps to run the program:
 
1. Open Assignment-5 project from IDE
2. Run the command in terminal 
```
    -  g++ main.cpp utils.cpp -o main
    - ./main
```

At the beginning of the program, the user will be prompted to enter a message to encode. 

```
  Enter a message
  Hello World
```

 Afterwards, the program will display both the encoded and decoded versions of the message as follows:

```
Coded message: 
.... . .-.. .-.. ---  .-- --- .-. .-.. -.. 
Decoded message: 
hello world 

```
